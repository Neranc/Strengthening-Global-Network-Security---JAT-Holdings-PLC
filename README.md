## Business Challenges
- **Disparate firewalls** across head office and remote branches.  
- **Inconsistent security policies** across different regions.  
- **Growing remote workforce** accessing resources globally.  
- **Operational complexity** in managing policies and VPNs.  
- **Need for scalable global security** to align with business expansion.  

---

## Tailored Solution
We implemented **Palo Alto Prisma Access SASE**, a **cloud-delivered security framework**, designed to bring consistency, scalability, and advanced protection.  

**Design focus areas:**  
- Unified **firewall + secure web gateway + DNS Security + ZTNA**.  
- **Azure AD identity integration** for secure authentication.  
- Low-latency **global cloud gateways** for distributed workforce.  
- **Zero Trust security model** with granular access policies.  
- Cloud-native architecture for **future scalability**.
